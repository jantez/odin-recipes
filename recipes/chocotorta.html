    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 oz Dulce de Leche</li>
        <li>5.3 oz Cream Cheese remove from fridge and allow it to soften</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Creme fraiche or sour cream optional</li>
        <li>8 oz Chocolate Cookies depending on the size of your dish</li>
        <li>1 cup coffee freshly brewed</li>
        <li>1 oz Valrhona dark chocolate for garnishing</li>
        <li>Parchment paper optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, using a hand mixer, combine the dulce de leche and cream cheese and beat until fluffy. Add creme fraiche or sour cream and continue mixing. It should be a light caramel color with no lumps. Taste to achieve the ratio you like. Reserve</li>
        <br>
        <li>Brew a cup of black coffee and pour it in a shallow dish. This is for dipping the chocolate cookies to make them moist. Make sure not to dip them for too long or they will get soggy and crumble.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Line your dessert baking dish with parchment and begin building the Argentina cake.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Submerge each chocolate cookie one by one in the coffee and line them across the parchment paper in the dessert baking dish. You may need to break up a couple of cookies to get the right geometrical shape to cover the entire surface.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour some of the dulce de leche mixture and spread evenly with a spatula. Arrange another layer of coffee-soaked cookies. And then, add another layer of the dulce de leche mixture.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Continue adding layers of chocolate cookies dipped in coffee followed by more dulce de leche mixture.</li>
        <br>
        <li>You should have at least four layers of cookies ending with a layer of dulce de leche.</li>
        <br>
        <li>For garnishing, melt a few squares of high-quality dark chocolate and pour on top of the last layer of dulce de leche.</li>
        <br>
        <li>After having made the recipe for the first time, we would now recommend delicately melting the chocolate. Instead of melting the chocolate over a stovetop, we recommend using the bain marie method for a smooth finish.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once you have spread it out evenly, grate a few dark chocolate squares and sprinkle over the Argentina cake.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cover with a plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least four hours. The longer the Argentina cake sits in the refrigerator, the better it gets.</li>
    </ol>
